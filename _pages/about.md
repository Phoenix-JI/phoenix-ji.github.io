Hello! Welcome to my personal webpage. I'm Phoenix JI, a data scientist with a love for creating impactful data solutions. With almost three years in the industry, I've worked on projects ranging from banking applications to the ESG data products. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and music (Landlord's Cats). I am based on Toronto now and looking for the data/tech/analyst/product opportunity in Canada !!! Feel free to reach out me if you'd like to connect!

I was a data scientist working in the LRQA Group Limited, focusing on developing the end- to-end ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) product by leveraging the data science and NLP (Natural Language Processing) skills. I have almost 3 years of experience in designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models, data-driven solutions, automation, product management, business intelligence & analyst and ESG analytics, complemented by 1+ year of academic research experience in data-driven business management and strategy. Proven track record of success in project management, problem-solving, and cross-functional collaboration. Highly educated professional holding both a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am seeking a challenging data/analyst/product role that leverages my expertise in designing and implementing innovative solutions to tackle complex business and engineering problems, driving business growth and strategic decision-making.

======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 


**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
