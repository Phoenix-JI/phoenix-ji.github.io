Greetings! Welcome to my personal webpage. I'm Phoenix JI, a data scientist with a love for creating impactful data solutions. With almost three years in the industry, I've worked on projects ranging from banking applications to the ESG data products. In my free time, I enjoy hiking and music (Landlord's Cats). I am based on Toronto now and looking for the data/tech/analyst/product opportunity in Canada !!! Feel free to reach out me if you'd like to connect!


Professional Experience
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
